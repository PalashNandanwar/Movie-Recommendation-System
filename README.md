Movie Recommendation System
This is a movie recommendation system built to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and behavior. It uses collaborative filtering techniques and content-based filtering to make recommendations, ensuring diverse and personalized suggestions.

Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies based on the characteristics of movies the user has previously liked.
Personalized Recommendations: Takes into account the userâ€™s movie rating history and movie metadata to suggest relevant films.
User Interface: Simple, intuitive web interface to view and rate movies.
Movie Metadata: Uses movie genres, descriptions, and tags for better recommendations.
Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React)
Backend: Python (Flask/Django) / Node.js (Express)
Machine Learning: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
Database: MySQL / MongoDB
API: TMDB (The Movie Database) API for movie data and metadata

Usage
User Registration: Users can create an account and log in to save their movie preferences.
Rate Movies: Users can rate movies, and the system will use this data to recommend movies.
View Recommendations: After rating a few movies, users can see personalized movie suggestions.
Recommendation Engine
The recommendation system works by using two main techniques:

Collaborative Filtering
Analyzes the rating patterns of users and recommends movies based on the preferences of similar users.
Example: If user A likes movies X and Y, and user B likes movies Y and Z, the system may recommend movie Z to user A.
Content-Based Filtering
Uses the movie metadata (genres, descriptions, etc.) to recommend movies similar to those that the user has already liked.
Example: If a user likes action movies, the system will suggest more movies from the action genre.
Demo
You can explore the demo version of the Movie Recommendation System on Live Demo.
